# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This is mostly just a practice and a reference guide for common data structures and algorithms.
Everything will be implemented in Python, which is kind of disappointing since implementing
everything in C++ would probably be more useful from a computer science perspective.
Perhaps in the future I will do precisely that.
